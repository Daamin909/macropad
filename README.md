### Inspiration

I wanted to boost my productivity and add an aesthetic looking device to my desk setup.

### Challenges

Believe it or not, this was my first time using Fusion 360! I spammed ChatGPT and #hackpad with queries. It also took me a lotta time making the PCB and routing it ðŸ˜­. I had to reroute a hundred times.

### Case

The case features a very hot Orange and Black look with the keycaps being black and Knob being orange too.

Branding: There is a "Shrek" engraving on both the bottom and middle plate. The top case features an engraving of Shrek's face.

Thickness

- Top: 7mm
- Middle: 1.5mm
- Bottom: 11.5mm
- **Total:** 20mm
